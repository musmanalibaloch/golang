Golang Basic Directory

Just clone it and set your path variable

$GOPATH = $HOME/path to golang directory                         

Note: YOU CAN ECHO $PATH and set your path accordingly

$GOBIN  = $HOME/path to golang directory/bin



And then enjoy coding :-)

p.s

Dont forget to change the name of directory which is based on github username in my case it is musmanalibaloch, replace it with your's username
